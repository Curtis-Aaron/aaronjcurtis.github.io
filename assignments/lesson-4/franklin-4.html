                <a href="images/Reservoirs.png" alt="Johnson Reservoir in Franklin County Idaho"></a>
                <p>Reservoirs in Franklin County will be open to public use Memorial Day weekend. The Consolidated Irrigation Company will follow the same action taken during the previous seasons to prevent the spread and risk of infestation by the Quagga and Zebra mussel. 

                “The board of directors, at the direction of our shareholders, have not taken this risk lightly. We have proceeded with the combined goal of protecting water resources and infrastructure for its intended agricultural uses,” states a release from the Consolidated Irrigation Company (CIC).

                CIC owns and operates four private reservoirs in Franklin County: Glendale, Johnson, Lamont, and Foster. Their purpose is to store water for irrigation for agricultural needs. 

                The Idaho Department of Agriculture Boat Check Station on the Utah/Idaho boarder in Franklin opened on March 30, and are open from daylight to dusk all season.

                “These facilities, along with the attendant diversion and delivery infrastructure, represent a substantial investment by the past and present shareholders of the company and are integral to the agricultural-based economy of Franklin County and Cache Valley. These reservoirs have been available to the public for fishing and other recreational uses for many years, free of charge, and with limited restrictions. The basis for free access was the minimal threat and potential impact from the public’s use to the Company’s infrastructure and operations,” states the release.

                “However, as the threat of infestation by Quagga Mussel and other invasive species continues it is necessary to further protect the company’s private reservoirs and important irrigation infrastructure so as to not jeopardize the company’s property and operations. 

                “The company has both a legal duty and a fiduciary duty to protect its private reservoirs and its associated irrigation infrastructure for the benefit of its shareholders. In 2014 Consolidated Irrigation Company, along with other local irrigation companies, sought input from the public, shareholders, governmental officials, and other interested parties as to how to safeguard these essential water facilities. Since then the working group, Franklin County Reservoir Alliance, has met frequently to formulate plans to that end.”

                CIC’s current policies regarding access to and use of company reservoirs Glendale, Johnson, Lamont, and Foster are: 

                All Reservoirs: 

                1. Access to each reservoir is limited to a single designated boat ramp. 

                2. Watercraft equipped with ballast compartments or bladders are prohibited on all reservoirs. 

                3. All watercraft using these reservoirs must have been inspected within the previous 5 days by an inspection station operated by and for the Idaho State Department of Agriculture (ISDA) and have in its possession written certification thereof. 

                Glendale Reservoir: 

                Persons will be stationed at the Glendale reservoir to verify that watercraft have been inspected by Idaho Department of Agriculture (ISDA) invasive species station prior to 

                launch. A third-party verification checkpoint will be in place at Glendale reservoir beginning May 25, 2018  and will be re-barricaded August 12, 2018. 

                1. All watercraft must have in their possession, written certification that the watercraft has been inspected within the previous 5 days by an inspection station operated by and for the Idaho State Department of Agriculture (ISDA). 

                2. Fees will be in place for the verification of watercraft at $20.00 each. 

                3. Fees for verification of watercraft owned by Franklin County residents has been reduced to $10.00 each from the support of Franklin County and Preston City. 

                4. Watercraft that are both inflatable and less than 10 feet in length are exempt from verification. 

                5. Idaho watercraft exiting Glendale reservoir will have the option of purchasing a security zip-tie for $1.00. If zip-ties are kept intact, watercraft may return to Glendale reservoir without undergoing Idaho State Department of Agriculture (ISDA) inspection. 

                6. The purchase of a security zip-tie does not wave the verification fee for the returning watercraft. 

                Glendale Reservoir Verification Checkpoint Non-operational Hours 

                1. Watercraft use on Glendale reservoir will be limited to fishing vessels only during verification checkpoint non-operational hours. 

                2. During verification checkpoint non-operational hours, watercraft owners shall present proof of current ISDA inspection in the window of their vehicle or upon request by verification staff. 

                3. Watercraft launched during verification checkpoint non-operational hours will be subject to verification fees upon exiting the reservoir. 

                Watercraft equipped with ballast compartments/bladders are prohibited.

                Until May 25, Glendale reservoir access ramp will be barricaded and the watercraft use limited to fishing only. Additional policy and information regarding CIC reservoirs will be posted at Franklinswcd.net or on Franklin County Reservoir Alliance page on Facebook. It will be open until Aug. 12.

                CIC directors recognize that Glendale reservoir is an important asset to the recreational community and appreciates their support and patience in adapting to these necessary measures.  

                “We have heard from and recognize the strong presence of local recreational users at Glendale Reservoir. We will continue to need the support of the entire community; the threat associated with the invasive mussels has not been eliminated,” states the release.

                Watercraft on local reservoirs require proof of current ISDA inspection in the window of their vehicle or upon request by verification staff. 

                Rules specific to the other reservoirs are as follows: 

                Lamont Reservoir: 

                1. Watercraft use is limited to fishing only.  

                Foster Reservoir: 

                1. Hand propelled or electric trolling motors only. 

                Johnson Reservoir: 

                1. Watercraft use is limited to fishing only. 

                Persons who violate these rules may be subject to civil damages for trespassing, states the release.

                “We regret any inconvenience that may result from these restrictions, but they are necessary to protect the valuable resources in our community. Any inconvenience is minor when compared to the potential significant impact from Quagga Mussels,” states the CIC release.

                “In drafting these policies, the company has solicited and received input from as many interested individuals and groups as possible. Contamination and infestation of invasive species will be disastrous to the private reservoirs and irrigation systems, resulting in more restrictive measures for everyone. 

                “The company trusts that everyone will cooperate in efforts to prevent the spread of these invasive species by following the policies set forth by the company. Thank you for your cooperation.”</p>
